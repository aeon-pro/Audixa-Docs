## Understanding Credits

All audio generation is measured in **credits**. Before you choose a plan, it's important to understand how credits, tokens, and models relate.

-   **Token:** 1 token = 1 UTF-8 character (including letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces).
-   **Audio Estimate:** On average, it takes about **1,000 tokens** to generate **1 minute** of audio.

The cost in credits depends on the model you use:
* **Basic TTS:** 1 Credit = 1 Tokens (Lower credit cost, ideal for high volume)
* **Advance TTS:** 4 Credits = 1 Token (Higher quality and cloning, higher credit cost)

For example, 10,000 credits can be used for either:
* **~40 minutes** of Basic TTS (40,000 credits * 1 tokens/credit = 40,000 tokens)
* **~10 minutes** of Advance TTS (40,000 credits * 0.25 token/credit = 10,000 tokens)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are credits and how are they calculated?
Credits are used to generate audio. The conversion from credits to tokens depends on the model you use. For our basic text-to-speech (TTS) models, **1 credit equals 1 tokens**. For our advance TTS models, **4 credits equals 1 token**. On average, you can expect to use approximately 1,000 tokens for every minute of audio you generate.

### How many tokens does it take to generate one minute of audio?
On average, it takes about **1,000 tokens** to generate one minute of spoken audio. This means you can estimate your audio limits based on your total tokens or credits:
- For Basic TTS: 1 credit = 1 tokens
- For Advance TTS: 4 credit = 1 token
For example, 40,000 tokens will generate approximately 40 minutes of audio.

### How do I know how many tokens my text will use?
Each token equals one UTF-8 character, including letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces. For example, “Hello world!” is 12 tokens. You can estimate your usage using any standard character counter.

### What happens if I use all my credits?
On the **Basic** and **Starter** plans, your service will be paused once you run out of credits. You can upgrade your plan to continue using the service. For the **Pro** plan, you can continue generating audio on a pay-as-you-go basis. As long as you have funds in your API wallet, additional usage is billed at the fixed prices listed in the table.

### Can I switch between Basic and Advance TTS with my credits?
Yes! You can use credits for either Basic TTS (more time per credit) or Advance TTS (higher quality, fewer minutes per credit). You choose which model to use every time you make an API request.

### Is the Basic plan really free?
Yes! Our **Basic** plan is completely free. It gives you **40,000 credits** to test out our platform, with no credit card required. This is enough for about 40 minutes of basic TTS or 10 minutes of advance TTS.

### Do you support white-label or custom enterprise integrations?
Absolutely! The **Enterprise** plan includes full white-label capabilities, custom admin panels, OEM integration, and tailored usage limits. Contact Sales for custom pricing and features.

### Can I change my plan anytime?
You can upgrade your plan whenever you like. Your new plan’s limits will take effect immediately, and you’ll be charged for the new plan upon upgrade.

### Do credits or tokens expire?
Credits and tokens reset each billing cycle based on your plan. Unused credits typically do not roll over, unless specified by your plan or custom agreement.

### I need more than what’s listed. Is that possible?
Yes! If you need larger limits or special integrations, reach out to our Sales team for a custom enterprise deal.
