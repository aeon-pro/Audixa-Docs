# AI Models

Audixa AI offers two powerful text-to-speech models to suit different needs: `Base` and `Advance`. Each model is optimized for a different set of use cases, from general-purpose narration to highly expressive, custom voice generation.

Understanding the differences will help you choose the best model for your application.

## Base Model

The **Base** model is the perfect choice for a wide range of applications. It is designed for reliability, speed, and high-quality audio output across a large and diverse voice library.

-   **Extensive Voice Library:** Comes with **54 preset voices** spanning various accents, genders, and styles.
-   **High Quality:** Delivers clear, natural-sounding speech suitable for narration, content creation, and accessibility.
-   **Simplicity:** Easy to use with straightforward API parameters.

For the majority of users, the **Base** model provides more than enough variety and quality to build incredible audio experiences.

## Advance Model

The **Advance** model is built for users who require the highest level of customization, expressiveness, and unique vocal identity. While it has a smaller library of preset voices, its power lies in its advance features.

-   **Voice Cloning:** Create a digital replica of any voice from a short audio sample.
-   **Custom Voices:** Design unique, high-quality synthetic voices tailored to your brand or project.
-   **Superior Expressiveness:** The model is fine-tuned for more nuanced and emotionally resonant speech.
-   **Greater Customization:** Offers more detailed control over the final audio output.

The **Advance** model is ideal for enterprises, creators, and developers who need a signature voice or the flexibility of voice cloning.

## Specifying a Model in Your API Request

To use a specific model, simply set the `model` parameter in the body of your `POST` request to the `/tts` endpoint.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="model-choice">
  <TabItem value="base" label="Using the Base Model" default>

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, this is a voice from the Base model.",
  "voice": "am_Ethan",
  "model": "base"
}
````

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="advance" label="Using the Advance Model">

```json
{
  "text": "This voice is generated by the more expressive Advance model.",
  "voice": "custom_voice_id_123", // Example custom voice ID
  "model": "advance"
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
