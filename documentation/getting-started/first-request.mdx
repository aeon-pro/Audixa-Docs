# Make Your First API Request

Once you're familiar with generating voices through the dashboard, you can start using the Audixa API to integrate text-to-speech into your own applications and workflows.

This section shows you how to make your first programmatic request using the API.

---

## API Endpoint

To generate speech, send a `POST` request to the following endpoint:

```
POST https://api.audixa.ai/v2/tts
```

---

## Required Headers

```http
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from the [Dashboard](https://audixa.ai/dashboard/api).
:::tip
### How To Get Your API Key

1. Log in to your [Dashboard](https://audixa.ai/dashboard).
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section.
3. Click Regenerate.
4. Copy your private API key.
:::

:::warning
Do Not Expose **API Key** in Frontend Code
Your API key contains sensitive credentials that can be abused if exposed.
Always keep it securely stored and accessed from the backend/server.
Exposing it in client-side code (HTML, JavaScript) may lead to:
- Unauthorized usage
- Data theft
- Unexpected charges or bans
- Security vulnerabilities

**Best Practice:** Route all API requests through your backend to protect the key.

## Basic Example Request Body

```json
{
  "text": "Welcome to Audixa AI, your affordable text-to-speech solution.",
  "voice": "am_Ethan",
  "model":"base",
  "speed": 1
}
```
- `text` - The content you want to convert to speech.
- `voice` - Voice ID (see [Voice Library](https://audixa.ai/dashboard/library) for available voices).
- `speed` - Speed of the speech. Range: 0.5 to 2

  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

    "voice": "am_Ethan",
    "model":"base",
    "speed": 1
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.audixa.ai/v2/tts"
headers = {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"

const response = await fetch("https://api.audixa.ai/v2/tts", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: "Welcome to Audixa AI, your affordable text-to-speech solution.",
    voice: "am_Ethan",
    speed: 1
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Check Generation Status

Once you've made a request, the API will return a response containing a `generation_id` (if the request was successful).

You can check the generation status in two ways:

1. **From the Dashboard**  
   Visit your [Dashboard](https://audixa.ai/dashboard/generations) to see the latest requests and download audio once ready.

2. **Using the API**  
   Use the `/status` endpoint to programmatically check the status of a request using the `request_id`.

For details on how to use the status endpoint, see the [API Reference â†’ Status Endpoint](/api/endpoints/status).
