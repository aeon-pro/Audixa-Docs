# Authentication

To use the Audixa API, you need an API key. This key authenticates and authorizes your requests to our servers.

---

## Where to Get Your API Key

1. Go to the [Audixa Dashboard](https://audixa.ai/dashboard/api).
2. Sign up or log in to your account.
3. Navigate to the **API** section.
4. Click Regenerate
5. Copy your unique API key.

---

## How to Use Your API Key

Include your API key in the request headers using the `x-api-key` field.

### Required Header

```http
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Security Best Practices

- Keep your API key **private**. Never expose it in frontend code (JS, mobile apps, etc.).
- Store it in a secure environment variable or secret manager on your server.
- If you believe your key has been compromised, you can regenerate it from the dashboard.
