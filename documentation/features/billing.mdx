This guide explains each section of the billing dashboard.

## Subscription Details

This section shows the current status of your monthly or annual subscription. What you see here depends on whether you are on the free (Basic) plan or a paid plan.

* **Active Subscription (Paid Plans)**
    If you are on a Starter or Pro plan, this card will show your active plan name, the next renewal date, your monthly usage percentage, and the payment method on file.

* **Basic Plan (Free Users)**
    If you are on the Basic plan, this card will show "No Active Subscription" and provide an **Upgrade Now** button to select a paid plan.

### Managing Your Subscription

For paid plans, this section contains a **Manage Subscription** button. This button securely redirects you to our external payment provider's customer portal.

Inside this portal, you can:
* Update or change your payment method (credit card).
* Cancel your subscription.
* View and download all past invoices.

## API Wallet Balance

The **API Wallet** is a separate, pay-as-you-go balance that you can add funds to at any time. Its primary purpose is to cover any overages on the **Pro plan**.

:::note Pro Plan Overage
Additional (pay-as-you-go) usage is an exclusive feature of the **Pro plan**. If you are on the Basic or Starter plan, your API access will be paused once you exhaust your monthly credits. Pro plan users can continue generating audio uninterrupted, and any usage beyond their plan's limit will be deducted from their API Wallet balance.

### How to Add Balance
1.  Click the **Add Balance** button.
2.  A dialog will appear prompting you to enter an amount in USD.
3.  The amount must be a whole number (integer) and the **minimum deposit is $10**.
4.  Clicking "Proceed" will take you to a secure payment page to complete the transaction. The funds will appear in your wallet shortly after.

* **Paid Plans (Starter, Pro, Enterprise):** Your account has access to **Priority Support**. Clicking the "Contact Support" button will open a direct line to our priority support team.
* **Basic Plan:** Users on the Basic plan can contact general support. The "Contact Priority Support" button will prompt you to upgrade your plan to gain access to the priority queue.
