## Error Codes

We use standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Codes in the `2xx` range signal success, `4xx` codes indicate a client-side error (a problem with your request), and `5xx` codes indicate a server-side error on our end.

All error responses return a JSON object containing a `detail` key with a human-readable error message.

```json
{
  "detail": "A specific message explaining what went wrong."
}
```

## HTTP Status Code Summary

### 400 Bad Request

This is the most common client-side error. It means your request was malformed, incomplete, or contained invalid data. You should **not** retry the request without modifying it first.

Common causes include:

  * **Malformed JSON:** The JSON body you sent is syntactically incorrect.
  * **Missing Required Field:** A required parameter like `text` or `voice` was not included in the request body.
  * **Invalid Parameter Value:** You provided data that failed validation.
      * `"detail": "Invalid voice ID"`
      * `"detail": "Invalid Emotion | Expected: [...]"`
      * `"detail": "Invalid Temperature | Expected Range: ..."`
  * **Text Too Short:**
      * `"detail": {"error": "Text must be at least 30 characters long."}`
  * **Missing Query Parameter:** You called an endpoint (like `/voices`) without a required query parameter (like `model`).

-----

### 401 Unauthorized

This means your request failed to authenticate. This is purely an issue with your API key.

  * **`"detail": "Invalid API Key"`**
    This response occurs if your `x-api-key` header is missing, incorrectly spelled, or contains a key that is not valid or has been revoked. Check your key and try again.

-----

### 402 Payment Required

This error relates specifically to billing and your account balance.

  * **`"detail": "Insufficient Balance"`**
    This error is returned from the `POST /tts` endpoint when your account does not have enough credits to cover the cost of the requested generation. See our [Understanding Credits](./credits) guide for details.

-----

### 403 Forbidden

This error means your request was authenticated successfully, but your account does not have permission to perform the requested action.

This occurs in two main situations:

1.  **Plan Restriction:** You are trying to use a feature your plan does not include.
      * **`"detail": "This voice is only available for paid plans..."`**
2.  **Access Denied:** You are trying to access a resource that belongs to another user.
      * **`"detail": "Access denied for this generation"`** (This happens if you query the `/status` endpoint with a `generation_id` that belongs to a different account).

-----

### 404 Not Found

This means the resource you are asking for does not exist.

  * **`"detail": "Generation not found"`**
    This is returned by `GET /status` when the provided `generation_id` does not match any job in our system. This can happen if the ID is incorrect or if the job is very old and has been purged.
  * This will also be returned if you make a request to an undefined API path, such as `/v2/status`.

-----

### 429 Too Many Requests

This means you have exceeded your rate limit (the number of API requests allowed in a given period). If you receive this error, you should stop sending requests and wait before retrying, ideally using an exponential backoff strategy. Please see our [Rate Limits](./ratelimits) page for details.

-----

### 500 Internal Server Error

This means something went wrong on our end. These errors are rare, but if you receive one, it is not your fault.

Common `detail` messages include:

  * `"detail": "Error Occured While Updating Credits..."`
  * `"detail": "Error Occured while Creating generation..."`

If you receive a `500` error, the best practice is to wait a few moments and retry the request. If the error persists, please check our status page or contact support, as it indicates a problem with our services.
